probablity_pixel=numpix/totalnum
numpix-> number of occurance of a pixel with certain intensity value

totalnum number of pixels in the input image

for ex: 1if 100 pixels -> 100 huffman code words 
-----------
pixel valuses int the input image will be leaf nodes 

steps 
1> building huffman tree
2>  a> combine the two lowest probablity leaf nodes into single new node 
    b> Replaceing rhe two nodes by new one and sorting the nodes according to new probablityvalues
    b> continure till we get single node with prob 1,0 --> as  root node
3>backtrack from the root, assigning 0 or 1 to each intermediate node, till we reach leaf nodes
0 to the left and 1 to the right 

//1//read the image into a 2d array
